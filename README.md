## What I Do

- [Written two books on how to break into Game Audio](https://nir.media)
- Helped create audiovisual building designs for _Microsoft_, _University of Washington_, and _Amazon_ including the famous *Amazon Spheres*
- Helped develop 2 seasons of a proto-YouTube webseries for _Penny Arcade_
- Twice ran live sound for a stunt pilot who _sang from his airplane while doing stunts_
- Worked on Movies, TV, Commercials, Live and Studio Music, etc.

## What I'm Into Outside of Work

- I have a lifelong fandom of The Muppets
